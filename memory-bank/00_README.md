# Memory Bank

This folder is your personal “memory bank” for storing documentation, workflows, summaries, and notes.

## File Ordering
- Prefix filenames with `00_`, `01_`, etc., to control sort order.
- The first file (`00_README.md`) explains the folder’s purpose and conventions.

## Conventions
1. Use Markdown (`.md`) for readability.
2. Group related files into subfolders as needed (e.g., `/memory-bank/topics/`).
3. Update this README when conventions evolve.
4. Keep entries concise and focused on actionable guidance.

## Next Steps
- Add `01_CLINE_TOOLS.md` to document available tools.
- Add additional notes or workflows following the naming conventions.
